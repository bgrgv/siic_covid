                                <b>Proposal:</b><br> This is an automatic Ambu bag pressing machine which can be used as an alternate to full-fledged ventilators to provide forced breathing to the patient who is having respiratory problems. The device
                                operation is automated with the help of an electromechanical system. The goal is to ensure a minimum safe ventilator functionality based on clinical guidance with the lowest cost and easily manufacturable solution. The
                                concept is to squeeze the ambu bag which is a standard medical equipment in a certain breathing pattern for the patient. This ventilator has easily customizable breathing frequency with the help of this knob from 10 beats
                                to 30 beats per minute and breathing volume can be customized with the help of this knob from 300 ml to 450 ml. Inhale/Exhale ratio can also be customized. A buzzer is kept for intimation in case of system failures. This
                                kill switch is used to stop the system in case of emergencies. The bag can be easily detached from the system in case system fails and operator has to manually pump the air. Concept
                                <br> • The concept is to use an Ambu bag and squeeze it with the help of an automated setup to give pressurized breathing air to the patient. <br> • Ambu bag is a standard medical equipment available easily and generally
                                used by hand by a medical professional. Our aim is to automate this squeezing process so that it can be used for longer durations with easy customizability based on different patients.<br> • A stepper motor is used and
                                controlled with the help of a driver. This is connected to a metal spur gear which is the driver gear in this setup. The driver gear is connected to two driven gears with a gear ratio of 1:5. These two driven gears are
                                attached to the arms which are squeezing the Ambu bag. <br> • The rate of breaths per minutes and volume of breathing can be controlled from knobs by the operator. A pressure sensor and a pressure relief valve are used
                                for the operator to analyse the breathing pressure for inhale and exhale.
                                <br> • An LCD display is provided which shows the operating conditions of the ventilator. A buzzer and an Emergency kill switch is provided in case of failures. The bag is no mechanically attached to the ventilator and
                                can be easily removed by the operator in case the system stops working. <br>

                                <b>Key Features</b><br> • Easily Customizable breathing frequency (Respiratory rate) from 10 beats per minute to 45 beats per minute. This can be controlled by a knob depending on patient.<br> • Easily customizable breathing
                                or tidal volume (volume of air being pushed into the lungs) from 100 ml to 600 ml for each breadth. This can be controlled by a knob depending on patient’s body weight. <br> • Easily customizable inspiratory/expiration
                                time ratio between 1:1 to 1:4. This can be controlled with the help of a knob. <br> • Live monitoring of air way pressure through a pressure sensor and an adjustable pressure relief valve to control the pressure in the
                                duct. <br> • Manual Clinician override in case of ventilator failure for redundancy. Easy conversion to manual ventilation in case of failures. <br> • Inline HEPA filter in the circuit to protect clinical staff from the
                                possible infection. <br> • A buzzer/alarm for intimation in case of failures. An emergency kill button is provided for the operator to kill the unit in case of system failures. <br> • An LCD Display for showing the operating
                                parameters of the machine. <br> • Easy conversion for both Adults and Paediatrics’ use<br>

                                a Face Shield to protect our frontline fighters. Face Shield can protect the frontline workers form almost all forms of exposure to covid-19 virus. It is stretchable, comfortable to wear for long hour. Without any discomfort

                                side part of the face. This prevents the virus from entering the person body through the eyes, nose and mouth. <br> • These forms of PPE have to be worn for extended hours and comfort in this was though off. The face shields
                                have been given proper foam padding in the areas that contact with the face. Also, a 1-inch thick elastic strap has been given to make it comfortable for extended use. <br> • The materials currently being used are PLA for
                                the band and PC for the transparent sheet. Both of these materials are bio inert and can be used even at places of emergency and hospitals <br>

                                <i>Problem:</i><br> Currently the hospitals in India are facing a huge crisis of medical equipment’s and medicines due to very narrow supply of equipment from china therefore the resources left need to be efficiently distributed
                                to the hospitals which are in dire need of the medication. Looking at the current scenario there should be no wastage of medicine in such a crisis therefor there is a need to track the consumption of the medical aid by
                                the hospitals and which is done manually in 71% of the hospitals across the country and looking into current scenario there is a shortage of manpower to track the consumption off the medication and therefore there is a
                                need of an automated inventory management system. <br>
                                <b>Solution:</b><br> An automated Inventory management system for Hospital & Medical Agencies. To track available stock of medicines and medical equipment’s. This will be greatly helpful to do resource management and to
                                create automated record of all the consumption. <br> Mainly two parts of this system:<br> 1. Hardware: Tray with Load Cells where medicine and equipment could be placed, which will be monitored online. <br> 2. Web Portal:
                                Where all the hardware could be accessed over network and manage all the stocks. With this portal all the medical agency’s available stock could be viewed, and order could be placed. <br>

                                and repeat the designated operation round the days on its own.

                                polymerization dissolved in water around 10% is proven to kill the virus.

                                Problem:The isolated patients in the hospitals are regularly needed to be checked and be provided timely medicines and food, take samples and disinfect. This process involves the doctors, nurses and attenders to visit them on a regular basis everyday.
                                There is another scenario when a patient dies, the attenders, nurses and doctors are extremely skeptical even to approach the body for the further process.
