                                system. The goal is to ensure a minimum safe ventilator functionality based on clinical guidance with the lowest cost and easily manufacturable solution. The concept is to squeeze the ambu bag which is a standard medical
                                equipment in a certain breathing pattern for the patient. This ventilator has easily customizable breathing frequency with the help of this knob from 10 beats to 30 beats per minute and breathing volume can be customized
                                with the help of this knob from 300 ml to 450 ml. Inhale/Exhale ratio can also be customized. A buzzer is kept for intimation in case of system failures. This kill switch is used to stop the system in case of emergencies.
                                The bag can be easily detached from the system in case system fails and operator has to manually pump the air.<br>By Rizel Automotive (Startup) : Currently Prototype developed, its in final

                                to the hospitals which are in dire need of the medication. Looking at the current scenario there should be no wastage of medicine in such a crisi s therefor there is a need to track the consumption of the medical aid by
                                the hospitals and which is done manually in 71% of the hospitals across the country and looking into current scenario there is a shortage of manpower to track the consumption off the medication and therefore there is a
                                need of an automated inventory management system. ​

                                <b>Solution:</b> An automated Inventory management system for Hospital & Medical Agencies. To track available stock of medicines and medical equipment’s. This will be greatly helpful to do resource management and to create
                                automated record of all the consumption. Mainly two parts of this system: Hardware: Tray with Load Cells where medicine and equipments could be placed, which will be monitored online. 2.Web Portal: Where all the hardware
                                could be accessed over network and manage all the stocks. With this portal all the medical agency’s available stock could be viewed, and order could be placed.

                                and repeat the designated operation round the days on its own.

                                Problem:The isolated patients in the hospitals are regularly needed to be checked and be provided timely medicines and food, take samples and disinfect. This process involves the doctors, nurses and attenders to visit them on a regular basis everyday.
                                There is another scenario when a patient dies, the attenders, nurses and doctors are extremely skeptical even to approach the body for the further process.
                                <br><br> Solution:The need of the hour is to aid them on their process and prevent them from coming in close contact with the isolated patients. This can be achieved by the usage of robots that does the job of delivering
                                food and medicine and help them with their sample testing and other activities.
